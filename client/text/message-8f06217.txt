Here is a run down of the assortment of facts that I have collected about 
this Mighty Oak character:

1. He rides a motorcycle. It is as yet untraceable to him.

2. He doesn't use a gun. He carries around a large hammer.

3. He is obsessed with MKBD Chemical now and as yet I cannot figure out 
what the connection is between him and them.

4. I found numerous audio logs recorded on a usb drive after the last 
Big Boss incident. Many of the later logs have to do with a group he 
calls "Mockingbird".

5. Big Boss Brewery was the first place he was officially spotted "in 
action" by numerous witnesses.
