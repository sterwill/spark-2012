From: The Mighty Oak
Subject: Gardedenol

Got into the MKBD files and looked around. Found out about Gardedenol. It's a 
steroid. Works through your skin on contact. Lowers your inhibition to 
suggestion. One touch, and you're a robot waiting for orders. The subject will
be more apt to believe what they're being told. An untruth serum. Mockingbird 
wants to use it to make people buy things just by touching them. Anything you 
had a sudden urge to buy? LiveCanary is out of its cage. Mockingbird is pushing 
the envelope to get this out the door.

We've got to stop them. I have access to the MKBD database and backups. I just 
need to crack the code. I can delete all their data. No more Gardedenol. Stop 
MKBD, stop their Mockingbird masters, save the city. I can't do this out in the
open. They've got someone looking for me. I need you to crack it, I'll do the 
rest. Go back to your LiveCanary test sites. Each one has a challenge to help 
field agents test their mental state. The challenges reveal a pair of shapes.
We can use those shape pairs to crack the encryption on the database. Once you
break the shell, I'll ruin the nest.
