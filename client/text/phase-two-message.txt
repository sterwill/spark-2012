Subject: Gardedenol

Got into the MKBD files and looked around. Found out about Gardedenol. It's a 
steroid. Works through your skin on contact. Lowers your inhibition to 
suggestion. One touch, and you're a robot waiting for orders. It stimulates 
the brain toward feelings of confidence and safety and trust. The subject will 
be more apt to believe what they're being told. An untruth serum. Mockingbird 
wants to sell it to marketing teams. Make people buy things just by touching them. Seen anything cool today? Anything you had a sudden urge to buy? LiveCanary is out of its cage. Mockingbird is pushing the envelope to get this out the door.

We've got to stop them. I have access to the MKBD database and backups. I just need to crack the code. I can delete all their data. No more Gardedenol. No more snake in your ear. Stop MKBD, stop their Mockingbird masters, save the city. I can't do this out in the open. They've got some investigator looking for me. I need you to crack it, I'll do the rest. You've got to help.

Go back to your LiveCanary test sites. Each one has a challenge to help field agents test their mental state. Helps make sure you didn't accidentally dose yourself. The challenges reveal a pair of shapes. We can use those shape pairs to crack the encryption on the database. Once you break the shell, I'll ruin the nest.
