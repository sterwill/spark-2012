Subject: Are you with MKBD or Mockingbird?

This city needs protecting.  The people need protecting.  Someone had to 
step up.  Someone had to do something.  There's forces out there.  Groups.  
Something bad is happening.  It's up to me to stop them.  I'll be Raleigh's 
hero.  Gladly.

Mockingbird.  I've got to find out who they are.  How are they controlling 
MKBD?  What do they want?  MKBD isn't all bad.  They just don't know what 
they're getting into.  I've got to find out.  There's something going on.
Keep watching.  I will be.

I know you're working with MKBD.  I hope I can trust you.  If I can, you'll
hear from me soon.
