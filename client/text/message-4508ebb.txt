Subject: Watching your progress.

I've been watching your progress.  Following my footsteps.  Are you learning 
what I learned?  Have you wondered why Mockingbird would take such care to 
exclude their agents from field tests?  Wondered what this is testing?  Ask 
the questions.  Why is a chemical company testing the public in secret?  Who 
pulled the strings for this?  They're watching me watching them.  Something 
sinister is happening.  Something is going on.  I need your help.  You've 
got an in.  LiveCanary is illegal.  I need to stop them.  I must protect 
these people.  MKBD is developing Gardedenol in spite of the FDA lockdown.  
Clinical research won't touch them.  The snake whispering in your ear.  
Keep going.  You'll hear from me soon.
