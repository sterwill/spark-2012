Good work ladies and gentlemen! You went further and faster in a short 
time than I did in months of work on the mystery of this Big Tree!

Who is this guy anyway? Have you followed at all? What do you think?

Who IS THE BIG TREE? Is he a MIGHTY NUT or a keen vigilante for justice?

I've kind of come to love this big lug after all this time following a 
sometimes lukewarm trail. He sure seems like he means well sometimes, 
except watch where he swings that hammer!

I'm looking forward to all of us figuring this mystery out, whoever he 
turns out to be!
