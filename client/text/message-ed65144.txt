Subject:  Following me.

I can tell I'm on the right track because they're trying to stop me.  Following me.
Trying to find me.  If I wasn't on to something big they would just treat me like
a crazy person.  But Mockingbird is trying to stop me.  I've been off the radar a
while now.  Suddenly someone is looking into the crimes I've stopped.  Doesn't pass
the sniff test.

I've been following delivery trucks for a while.  Trying to figure out what they're
up to.  They're keeping a lid on it.  Secrets.  Well kept ones.  But I've got it
now.  Someone finally talked.  Nobody argues with the hammer.  I got access to the
MKBD system.  Got to spend some time looking over the data.

I'll need to be careful now.  Mockingbird is going to come after me harder now.
