Man, this guy is full of surprises! Just when I thought I had him figured 
out, he continually surprises me. The last time he tried to break in to a 
locked Downtown MKBD office, he went like a ninja at night and burned 
through a locked door to a restricted area with thermite.

This surprises me because so far his regular street actions have made him 
appear to be a destructive gorilla-often doing more harm than good. Of 
course, this depends on who you talk to too! He has his fair share of 
saving kittens from trees and old ladies from buses like any one of the 
good guys.

This thermite thing has me even more stumped. You really have to know 
your "stuff" for a thermite reaction to work and the fuel and oxidizer 
to work in a controlled way. He may just be smarter than I originally 
thought.

Your friend Old Earl is stumped on this one and I've got to say, a mite 
impressed as well!
