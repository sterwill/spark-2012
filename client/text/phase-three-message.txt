Subject: Great job, my friends!

It turns out we were right, this guy really was a nut, though his mystery was 
a mighty one, indeed!

The plot got pretty thick there for a second, didn't it? I didn't know what 
would happen, or who would come out on top of this one. What did you think 
about that story about the plot by that suspicious group "Mockingbird"? Was 
there any truth to that at all?

It turns out The Mighty Oak was a young prodigy chemist named Dr. Edwin
Oakwood. His superiors had pretty high expectations of him before he went 
rogue and flipped. He was hired out of the MKBD factory as a young post-doc 
who had been named in or published numerous papers in his academic career.

That's right friends, he was a rogue MKBD employee who cracked up.

The choice of the name "Mighty Oak" is an interesting one, but not unusual, 
given his history. It turns out he's one of our own, a native of Raleigh. He
grew up with the imagery of the oak tree and the acorn. As a child I'm told
he loved the myth of Thor, which explains his weapon of choice-the hammer.

His love of this city, his fragile mind, and his obsession with Mighty Thor
as a child, all combined to give us this fascinating story.

Like that great quote I heard from David Icke:

"Today's mighty oak is just yesterday's nut, that held its ground."
