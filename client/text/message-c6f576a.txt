Hello again!


What have you learned so far? What ideas do you have about this guy?

I'll tell you, with months of following the trail of this guy, I've got 
a view of him that is more than fifty shades of grey!

I want to warn you not to be too quick to judge, like I originally did. That
will just leave you with a cold trail and a bad taste in your mouth as you 
realize you lost his scent.

So, do you think he's a madman yet? Maybe you think he's really a superhero? 
How great would that be-our fair Southeastern gem of a city with its very own 
quirky superhero?

Whatever we all think of him, I'm sure he's got surprises in store for us!
