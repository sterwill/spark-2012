The Mighty Nut seems obsessed with a group he calls "Mockingbird". I have 
never heard of this group and I am unsure of its existence at this point 
in time. I have come to wonder if many of the clues I follow around are just 
chasing figments of a madman's imagination, or if there is actually something
to this.

Witness statements either paint him as a crazed vigilante or a welcome 
superhero. Could there be truth to both ideas? Neither?

All witness statements agree that The Mighty Oak certainly has a flare for 
drama and destruction. The last sighting we have of him in action, some 
witnesses claim he was trying to break up a fight, while others say he 
started it. From what I know of him, I'd bet he added fuel to an already 
existing fire, as seems to be his M.O. Every witness sighting of this lug in 
action inevitably involves property damage from a large blunt object-a 
hammer.
